After deciding to stay in DC on a whim, we saw positive reviews for Savoy Suites on both booking.com and Tripadvisor.
C
It was one of the more affordable hotels listed, so we gave it a try and boy, do we feel like we got our money's worth.
B
The room was clean, nicely appointed and had absolutely no &quot;ick&quot; factor.
B
There was also a wonderful kitchen area (with sink, small fridge, microwave, counters/cabinets) that was a real happy surprise.
B
It was very worn.
A
We had a room on the 7th floor in the back and it was very quiet.
A
I really loved the location.
B
Savoy Suites was the perfect choice to stay for American University graduation.
A
It is very convenient--just around the corner from my sons apartment.
A
Saba, not only greets me at the front desk, she sees my stay always meets the high Savoy standards making my stays at the Savoy very pleasant.
A
Clean room, enough space and great neighborhood.
A
I visited DC last week with my mom and one of her friends, I picked the hotel through an online discount provider and hoped that the reviews I read were honest--they were.
B
The facilities, although a bit older, were clean, comfortable and the beds were heaven to fall into after a long day of sightseeing.
A
I chose to stay here rather than the more expensive conference hotel and am so happy I did.
A
All the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.
A
My family stayed here when I had my baby.
C
They were given a hospital rate and a local rate because we live in the area.
C
I think they also have a shuttle service to some hospitals, although my family did not use this.
A
The rooms looked nice.
B
When one walks in the door after shopping or whatever, they always said &quot;welcome Home&quot;, kind of a nice touch.
A
Summary, not a big name, but extremely nice hotel and a very good value for the DC area.
B
We stayed here one night while in town to see the sights in D.C. and chose Savoy Suites because it was the least expensive option in between D.C. &amp; Georgetown and a reasonable deal for D.C.
C
The bathroom was spacious as was the room itself and included Tempurpedic mattresses which were surprisingly comfortable despite my hesitations.
B
Check-In went off without a hitch, and Vince had a lot of suggestions for food in the local area.
A
We ended up taking his suggestion for The Dancing Crab which was an excellent suggestion.
A
There isn't much else to say about Savoy Suites, we had such a fantastic stay with them and we will definitely be back in the future!
A
Part of the hotel is upgraded and very nice, but even the older rooms are not much to complain about.
A
Parking used to be free, but we had to pay during our last visit.
B
The night I stayed at this location was great.
B
The staff greeted me warmly and the room was ready upon arrival.
B
There is lots to see around the general area and not too far from the other popular sites of Washington.
B
I think they could do more business if they had staff readily available at both to serve.
A
The hotwire booking meant we paid much less than the listed price - this was by far the best value/experience of our trip to Washington, we just wish we had more time to explore Georgetown.
C
So I walked out, looked around, nothing.
C
&quot;It's 8:31, you were late so he must have left.&quot; After I protested she shrugged and said, &quot;somebody else probably took it.&quot; The hotel did NOTHING to try to address this.
A
Every time that we visit, we receive exceptional service.
B
The one thing about the resturant that could be improved is that the meals didn't always come at the same time at dinner.
A
The price of staying at the hotel has gone up and up and up over the years, but despite that...
A
The garage is small so a large car would be a bit of a challenge to park but the parking fee is less then most other DC hotels and we had a spot every time.
